== Reproducer for https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-jpa/issues/2743

Reproduces the issue using Spring Data or JPA directly.
The hibernate module containes and independent reproducer based on Hibernates reproducer templates.

Reproduction is sporadic. Therefore one needs to run the tests multiple times.

It seems that the Spring based setup makes the error more likely. 10-20 runs of the tests in IntelliJ are sufficient to reproduce the issue reliably for me.
For the pure Hibernate variant 10-20 runs aren't always enough it seems, but the error occures eventually.
